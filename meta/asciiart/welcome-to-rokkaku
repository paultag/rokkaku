        You're reading this message because you've not configured Rokkaku
      yet. This is actually a  "background",  rather then  an interactive
      prompt. To help you get used to  your new app, here's a handy guide
      on how to get started.


      C-e  - invoke rokkaku command, or command sequence. This will spawn
             the rokkaku menu, with a listing of commands.


                       Thank you for using free software!
